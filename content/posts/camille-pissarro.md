## Camille Pissarro was born in 1830 on St Thomas, an island in the Danish West Indies.

The son of a French shopkeeper, who had moved to St Thomas to take over the family business, Pissarro spent his [formative years](https://impressionistarts.com/camille-pissarro-biography.html#1) on St Thomas and, from the age of 12, at a boarding school outside Paris.

Pissarro was not the most talented of the impressionists, and he himself remarked that:

> "No, like Sisley, I remain in the rear of impressionism".



But Pissarro was key to the [impressionist movement](https://impressionistarts.com/camille-pissarro-biography.html#2). He was patient, sensible and wise. These were critical characteristics: the impressionist movement was barraged by criticism and ridicule for the best part of two decades. So it needed someone steady to hold the rudder. This was particularly so given that Cezanne and Degas were difficult personalities.

Cezanne in fact commented that Pissarro was "a father to me" and the American impressionist Mary Cassatt remarked that Pissarro could have "taught the stones to draw". Pissarro's centrality can be seen in another way: he was the only impressionist to exhibit in all eight of the [independent exhibitions](https://impressionistarts.com/camille-pissarro-biography.html#2) held between 1874 and 1886.

Pissarro could also paint. He was first accepted to the Salon in 1859, at which stage his works were fairly traditional. But his palette lightened and his style became looser after he met Monet and Cezanne at Suisse's painting academy. Pissarro's finest work is his series of paintings of Boulevard Montmartre at different times of the day, completed in spring 1897.

Pissarro dabbled with [pointillism](https://impressionistarts.com/camille-pissarro-biography.html#3) — a method of painting using small coloured dots championed by [Georges Seurat](https://impressionistarts.com/georges-seurat-biography.html) and [Paul Signac](https://impressionistarts.com/paul-signac-biography.html) — but gave it up after four years on the basis that it was too artificial. Pissarro died in 1903, aged 73.
