      ### Paul Cezanne was born in Aix-en-Provence, in southern France, on 19
      January 1839.


      His father was an entrepreneur, running a hat-making business at the time of Cezanne’s birth (called Cezanne and Coupin), and going on to found the Cezanne and Cabassol Bank in 1854. Cezanne’s parents married in 1844, just after Cezanne turned five.


      #### Education and Paris


      Cezanne entered the local College Bourbon in 1852, making friends with[Emile Zola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Zola)and Baptistin Baille. Zola was to become a writer and art critic and Baille a scientist.


      Cezanne, Baille and Zola were known as "the inseparables". They played in the Provençal countryside, read poetry and classics, and carried out scientific experiments. But all this ended when Zola left for Paris in 1858.


      #### Interesting fact ...


      At about this time, Cezanne and his father quarreled. The problem was that Cezanne Snr wanted his son to study law, forbidding him to follow Zola to Paris until he passed his law exams. And so Cezanne started his legal studies in 1858.


      By 1861 Cezanne had dropped out and had persuaded his father to let him travel to Paris. He enrolled at Suisse’s studio while he tried to obtain admission to the Ecole des Beaux Arts. But he was rejected and, his fragile confidence destroyed, he fled back to Aix to work in his dad’s bank.


      Cezanne found being a bank clerk too boring and was back in Paris the next year; he soon became a copyist at the Louvre (ie an art student authorised to copy the works of old masters).


      #### 1863-70: Salon rejections


      Cezanne submitted a work to the Salon in 1863. It was rejected and Cezanne exhibited, together with works produced by[Manet](https://impressionistarts.com/edouard-manet-biography.html)and[Pissarro](https://impressionistarts.com/camille-pissarro-biography.html), at the Salon des Refusés.


      More rejections were to follow. In 1865, Cezanne’s first important attempt at still life—Still Life with Bread and Eggs—was turned down by the Salon. The next year, a portrait of Antony Velabregue was rejected; one juror commented that it appeared to be


      > “painted with a pistol."


      In 1870 Cezanne submitted another portrait to no avail, this time of his dwarf friend[Achille Emperaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achille_Emperaire).


      Cezanne put on a brave face:


      > “Institutions, stipends and honours are made only for idiots, pranksters and rogues ... I don’t give a damn”.


      But the truth was that the rejections cut him to the quick.


      #### Cezanne's dark period


      The period 1861-70 represents Cezanne’s so-called "dark period": his palette was dark; his themes were violent or erotic; and he often applied paint using a palette knife and not a brush. A typical work was Cezanne’s shocking painting entitled The Murder (1870, pictured). Another, from 1867, was called The Abduction.


      It was not until about 1870 that, encouraged by Pissarro, Cezanne adopted the impressionist style by lightning and brightening his colour schemes and painting with broader brush-strokes.

## Paul Cezanne was born in 1839 in Aix-en-Provence, southern France. He studied in Aix before joining the other impressionists in Paris in the early 1860s.

Cezanne struggled for the first two decades of his career: he was only once accepted by the [Salon](https://impressionistarts.com/paul-cezanne-biography.html#1) of the Academy des Beaux Arts (the exhibition of France's Fine Arts Academy that was critical to the success of new painters); and the critics tore his work to shreds when he exhibited with the other impressionists in [1874 and 1877](https://impressionistarts.com/paul-cezanne-biography.html#2).

Cezanne returned to Aix from Paris in the late 1870s with his tail between his legs. But he continued to paint works of his beloved Provence, most famously of [Mont Saint-Victoire](https://impressionistarts.com/paul-cezanne-biography.html#3) and of Provencal labourers in his five-painting series entitled [Card Players](https://impressionistarts.com/paul-cezanne-biography.html#5).

Cezanne did not achieve recognition until 1895, when the dealer Ambroise Vollard put on a [solo exhibition](https://impressionistarts.com/paul-cezanne-biography.html#5) of 160 of his works. Thereafter, prices for Cezannes skyrocketed, more solo-exhibitions followed, and Cezannes started being acquired by the world's leading galleries. Indeed, Cezanne holds the record for the most expensive impressionist painting ever sold (\$259 million for one of the Card Players).

Cezanne was not a happy man: he spent much of his adult life trying to please and placate his [pushy father](https://impressionistarts.com/paul-cezanne-biography.html#4) (from whom Cezanne concealed the fact that he had a son for over a decade!); he [severed ties](https://impressionistarts.com/paul-cezanne-biography.html#4) with his childhood friend, [Emile Zola](https://impressionistarts.com/emile-zola-biography.html), in 1886 after Zola wrote a novel seemingly based on Cezanne's life; and he was prone to depression and self-doubt.

Cezanne died on 22 October 1906, having caught pneumonia after being[ caught in a storm](https://impressionistarts.com/paul-cezanne-biography.html#5) painting.
