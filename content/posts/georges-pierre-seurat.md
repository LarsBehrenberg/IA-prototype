    text: >-
      ### Born in 1859 to a middle-class Parisian family, Seurat’s congenial
      childhood allowed him to explore his interest in painting from an early
      age.


      #### Seurat’s family


      Seurat’s mother, Ernestine Faivre, came from a wealthy family of sculptors in Paris, known as the Veillards. Her father was a jeweller in the Rue de la Barillerie and her family’s comfortable life was passed on to her children, they did not have to worry about finding a profitable trade or starting apprenticeships.


      Ernestine raised Georges and his brother and sister almost entirely on her own as their father spent much of his time outside the city. The children and their mother were very close. It was Ernestine’s brother, Paul Haumonté, who first began giving Georges informal painting lessons as he was an amateur painter himself.


      #### Black and white


      A portrait of Ernestine is now housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York titled [‘Embroidery; The Artist's Mother’](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/334652) from 1882-83. The piece is sketched from Conté crayon, a later favourite of Seurat, and the image is constructed entirely from tonal passages of black. There are no lines to distinguish features within the drawing, instead the work is an inky abstract image that builds up the figure’s peaceful face and hands with masterful shading.


      This drawing is characteristic of Seurat’s early interest and accomplishment in black and white drawings, which was a key area of focus at the beginning of his career. Similarly, this portrait is a fleeting sketch of a moment in time, another quality that was common to the artist’s early works. Seurat submitted this drawing to the [Paris Salon in 1883](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon_(Paris)) but it was rejected.


      #### Eccentricity in the family


      In contrast to his mother, Seurat’s father, Chrysostome-Antoine Seurat, was a highly unusual and eccentric man. He had accumulated great wealth through property speculation and retired from his job as a bailiff before Georges was born, following an accident in which he lost an arm. Since his retirement, he had lived almost permanently in a suburb outside of Paris called Le Rancy, returning once a week to briefly visit his wife and children in the city.


      For much of Seurat’s childhood, his father lived the life of a hermit.


      #### Seurat’s first studio


      In spite of this, it was at the cottage in Le Rancy that Seurat first began to paint outdoors, and this was also the location of Seurat’s first studio. A number of small oil sketches from this time indicate his interest in country life and the everyday scenes in the suburbs surrounding Paris. [‘The Stone Breaker’](https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.164960.html) from 1882 is a slightly later work that demonstrates his interest in the labourers in Le Raincy. Critics have likened this focus on working-class people to the work of [Gustave Courbet](gustave-courbet-biography.html).


      Another artistic influence inherited from his father was Seurat’s interest in simplifying images to provide them with greater monumentality. Art historians have linked Seurat’s paintings emphasising the figures as motifs to his father’s collections of religious images.


      Chrysostome-Antoine had a large number of illustrated broadsheets, intended for popular consumption, which featured religious subjects from Épinal. As a child, Seurat would have had a chance to study these simple works and this may have formed the base of his inspiration.


      Overall, the young student’s early artistic education was fairly traditional. He enrolled in a local art school around 1875 before moving to the École des Beaux-Arts, which was at this time run by [Henri Lehmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Lehmann). Lehmann was a student of [Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres](jean-auguste-dominique-ingres-biography.html) and as such, the teaching was firmly Neo-Classical, placing weight on drawing and composition.


      This style of formal training set Seurat apart from many Impressionist artists as he had the opportunity to learn the techniques of Neo-Classicism. Generally, Seurat accepted the teaching he was given, as indicated in his early life drawings and copies of sculptures that were entirely in keeping with his art masters’ instructions.


      However, he also conducted his own study in museums and libraries around Paris. It was his early discovery of Michel-Eugène Chevreul’s ‘The Principles of Harmony and Contrast of Colours’, which would be a key turning point in the development of Seurat’s artistic tastes and his wider career.

### Georges-Pierre Seurat was the founder of Neo-Impressionism and the pioneer of the Pointillist technique.

This method of applying dots of paint to create cumulative colour effects was Seurat’s defining contribution to 19th century French art. At a time of great artistic innovation, Seurat forged [his own, novel path](#1).

Through his original approach to painting using colour theory, Seurat moved away from the foundations of the [Impressionist movement](#2). Rather than working to capture a fleeting moment in time, he chose to produce carefully considered and stately works, albeit in a similar colour palette to the Impressionists.

In doing so, Seurat inspired a [new generation of artists](#3) to experiment with colour and particularly the technique of ‘mélange optique’ or optical mixing, to give their paintings greater vibrance and intensity. Before he reached the age of 30, Seurat had already established himself as the [new leader of the French avant-garde](#4).
