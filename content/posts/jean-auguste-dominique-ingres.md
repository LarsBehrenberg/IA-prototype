  - textTitle: Ingres' early life
    text: >-
      ### Born in August 1780, Ingres was the eldest of seven children. His
      early life was shaped significantly by his relationship with his father,
      Jean-Marie-Joseph Ingres. Joseph and his wife Anne Moulet, Ingres’ mother,
      lived apart for long periods of time.


      Surviving letters from Anne suggest that his father was an abusive partner and she suffered significantly as a result. Due to the strained relationship of his parents, Ingres grew up with very little contact with his surviving sisters, Augustine and Anne-Marie. He had no acquaintance with his twin brothers Pierre-Victor and Thomas-Alexis.


      #### Art tuition


      Joseph was the first person to teach Ingres about art. Ingres was a modest painter who lacked any particular specialism. He tried his hand as a sculptor, stonemason and musician as well.


      Joseph had a strong belief in his abilities and sought to pass his knowledge onto his son. After his early schooling was disrupted by the revolution in France in 1791, Ingres began studying at the academy of fine arts in Toulouse, known as [Academie Royale de Peinture, Sculpture et Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acad%C3%A9mie_royale_de_peinture_et_de_sculpture). His father moved with him to supervise his education, completely neglecting his wife and younger children.


      It was here that Ingres learnt to play the violin and he was a key member of the Orchestre du Capitole de Toulouse for three years. Shortly afterwards, the talented young man began studying painting under [Jacques Louis David](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques-Louis_David) in Paris in 1797. Described as one of the finest students in his class, Ingres was accepted into the École des Beaux-Arts within two years.


      #### Early works


      A painting of his father, dated to 1804 and titled ‘Jean-Marie-Joseph Ingres’ is gentle and flattering, suggesting the debt he felt he owed to him. Joseph encouraged Ingres to follow his artistic talent and this is reflected in Ingres’ portrayal of his father. This portrait contrasts with the sterner depictions that Ingres went on to paint for paying clients.


      Ingres’ most notable painting from this time is [‘The Ambassadors of Agamemnon in the tent of Achilles’](https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-auguste-dominique-ingres/ambassadors-sent-by-agamemnon-to-urge-achilles-to-fight-1801) also known as ‘The Envoys of Agamemnon’, painted in 1801. This neo-classical artwork won him the Prix de Rome the same year, granting him a scholarship to study in Rome at the Académie de France.


      Students were charged with painting an event from the Trojan War as written in Homer’s Iliad. Instead of representing action, Ingres chose a more reflective subject, depicting the moment in which Achilles refuses to return to the Trojan War. This composition showed his early sensitivity and originality.


      #### Ingres the portraitist


      Thanks to Napoleon’s war-mongering politics at the time, Ingres was forced to renounce his scholarship and stay in Paris due to a lack of funding. Instead, he began working as a portrait artist, a career that offered young artists a considerable income. He was greatly inspired by Raphael and the engravings of the English artist John Flaxman.


      At the age of 26, Ingres became engaged to a fellow painter and musician, Marie-Anne-Julie Forestier, who may also have been a pupil of David. Ingres’ drawing from 1806 of Julie and her family features several symbolic details, such as a dog to represent fidelity. They shared a love of music as well as art.


      #### Love life


      Unfortunately, the couple’s romance did not survive their separation when Ingres left for Rome in the autumn of 1806. Instead, Ingres married Madeleine Chapelle, a Parisian milliner who moved to Rome to live with him. Julie wrote a novel about her ill-fated romance with Ingres and continued to paint, never marrying. Some of her artworks were shown in the Salons of 1804 and 1819.


      Whilst in Rome, Ingres’ life took a great number of twists and turns. He gained a reputation as an accomplished portraitist, completing [paintings of prominent figures like Queen Caroline Murat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrait_of_Caroline_Murat,_Queen_of_Naples) in Naples and commissions from the French governor of Rome. Whilst these were privileged opportunities, Ingres was enormously affected by the political swings happening in Europe.


      With the fall of Napoleon’s dynasty and the Murat regime, Ingres found himself trapped in Rome with no funds or patrons. He was forced to become a portraitist for English tourists, drawing miniatures in pencil for minimal reward. This pushed the artist’s pride almost to breaking point. It was only in October 1824 that Ingres and his wife were finally able to return to Paris.

    text: >-
      ### Despite his classical background and success in the École des
      Beaux-Arts, Ingres disliked the influence of the Salon on French art.


      #### Ingres and the Salon


      He saw it as a disrupting force that pushed artists to consider monetary gain and commercial success over the pursuit of originality. Ingres strongly believed that [the Salon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon_(Paris)) was smothering the beauty in art in favour of achieving recognition and glory.


      In doing so, he aligned himself with the more revolutionary artists among his colleagues. These artists paved the way for the [Impressionists](https://impressionistarts.com/index.html) to establish their own exhibitions, firmly breaking with the conventions of the Salon.


      Nevertheless, Ingres continued to seek professional praise and recognition, choosing to pursue history painting. History painting was a highly respected genre at this time. Ingres’ paintings were [Neoclassical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassicism) in every way but he still tried to innovate in some respects. He deliberately chose more emotional and psychological subjects than many of his peers, hinting at the influence of Romanticism on his work.


      #### Ingres and Delacroix


      One of the most notable features of Ingres’ professional life was his rivalry with [Delacroix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eug%C3%A8ne_Delacroix). Much like [Constable](https://greatestbritons.com/john-constable-biography.html) and [Turner](https://greatestbritons.com/william-turner-biography.html), Ingres and Delacroix were the subject of much gossip thanks to their open contempt towards one another.


      They grappled for favour at the Salon, each dismissing the other’s artistic style, one as a Romantic painter with a love of colour, the other as a restrained, refined academic painter.


      The two rivals have often been placed at opposite ends of a spectrum to highlight their divide: Delacroix as a flamboyant and sensual artist compared to Ingres who focussed on clean lines and strict rules. In the [Universal Exhibition of 1855 in Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposition_Universelle_(1855)), the two artists had to be physically divided into separate rooms to avoid conflict.


      Such a contrast between the artists has arguably been heavily exaggerated for the sake of drama. Whilst their painting style is certainly different in many ways, Ingres’ work does not lack intensity. Look closer at his detailed, precise work and there is an underlying passion. Even Delacroix admitted in his journal that Ingres’ work had “many fine qualities”. He was one of the few supporters of Ingres’ 1811 work depicting Jupiter and Thetis, which was heavily criticised by the Paris establishment.


      #### Ingres’ nudes


      In fact, Ingres’ art incorporated erotic styles from the Near East, combining them with western styles and the Romantic’s love of mythology.


      In doing so, he was able to paint female nudes whilst remaining removed from outrage, focussing on exoticised figures from ‘the Orient’. It was only when [the Impressionists](https://impressionistarts.com/index.html) began painting nude women from France that people became outraged.


      In his nudes, Ingres took inspiration from Botticelli and Italian Renaissance artists, whilst experimenting with his own colour palette. He used pure colours, described by [Henri Matisse](https://impressionistarts.com/henri-matisse-biography.html)as


      > “outlining them without distorting them.”




      With static lines he portrayed the female form in all the curving, bountiful beauty of the classical period. In this way, he also manipulated the bodies in his works, distorting them beyond natural limits to create a highly stylised final product. This is perhaps best seen in the elongated, disproportioned form of [‘La Grande Odalisque’](https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-auguste-dominique-ingres/the-grande-odalisque-1814) from 1814.


      #### Ingres and the critics


      One critic from 1832 described Ingres as “perhaps more of a sculptor than a painter; he occupies himself exclusively with line and form” stating that he “belongs in many respects to the heroic age of the Greeks”. As a result, Ingres can be understood as far more experimental than he has become known for, bridging the space between neoclassicism and romanticism.


      Regardless of contemporary criticism, Ingres’ Dionysian works would go on to shape the radically candid nudes of the Impressionists, including [Renoir](https://impressionistarts.com/pierre-auguste-renoir-biography.html), [Mary Cassatt](https://impressionistarts.com/mary-cassatt-biography.html) and [Gustave Caillebotte](https://impressionistarts.com/gustave-caillebotte-biography.html). ’The Valpinçon Bather’ (1808) would eventually become Renoir’s ‘Nude Seated on a Sofa’ (1876) and Degas’ ‘Woman Combing Her Hair’ (1888-1890), both of which echo the soft light and candid pose of Ingres’ work.

### In many ways Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres embodied the classical, academic style of painting that the impressionists sought to break away from. He was a key member of the old guard, painting religious and mythological subjects, while focusing on form and beauty.

However, his paintings are not quite as straightforward as conventional analysis would make them. Ingres manipulated Classical painting to create an alternative, abstracted style. He developed his [own fusion of neoclassicism and romanticism](https://impressionistarts.com/jean-auguste-dominique-ingres-biography.html#2), mixed with psychologically complex subjects in many cases. In doing so, he would go on to inspire prominent impressionist figures like [Auguste Renoir](https://impressionistarts.com/pierre-auguste-renoir-biography.html) and [Edgar Degas](https://impressionistarts.com/edgar-degas-biography.html), as well as later post-impressionist, Fauvist and cubist artists.

One explanation for Ingres’ mistaken identity in art history is his infamous rivalry with Eugene Delacroix. Delacroix was the ultimate Romantic painter and Ingres was placed in direct contrast to him. Consequently, Ingres gained a reputation for rigid artworks rooted in the academic style. Regardless of Salon politics, both artists were influential in the development of [Impressionism](https://impressionistarts.com/index.html) in different ways and each man played his part in progressing the visual vocabulary of French art.
