      ### In early 2002, the tiny oil-rich State of Qatar purchased one of Cezanne's five Card Players for a reported price of $259 million.


      | Sale Price: | Adjusted Price: | Date of Sale: | Buyer/Seller:                    |

      | ----------- | --------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------- |

      | $259m       | $338.4m         | Feb 2002      | State of Qatar/ George Embiricos |

      The adjusted price to take account of inflation is $338.4 million.


      The painting had been owned by Greek shipping magnate George Embiricos, who rarely showed it and had rejected offers for the work for decades.


      Towards the end of his life he relented and entered into negotiations with the [State of Qatar](https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2012/02/qatar-buys-cezanne-card-players-201202), finalised by his executors after his death.


      #### The painting


      Of the five versions of the Card Players that [Paul Cezanne](https://impressionistarts.com/paul-cezanne-biography.html) painted in the early to mid-1890s, this work is thought to be the last.


      It is certainly the most stripped-back of the collection, the earliest members of which feature three card players. The men playing cards are farmhands from Cezanne's beloved Provence that the artist paid to model for him.


      #### Interesting fact


      > Cezanne was a perfectionist. He sometimes required models to pose on scores of occasions before he was happy with the portrait he was painting of them. And on occasion he ripped up the finished product because he deemed it substandard.


      Painted in c. 1895, towards the end of Cezanne's life, Card Players is an iconic work: even those who are not impressionist fans are likely to recognise it.


      It is remarkable for a number of reasons:


      * The players are inert and totally focussed on their game, much as Cezanne was by this stage of his life obsessed by his art.

      * The proportions and scale of the painting are not quite right: check out the small heads, large bodies and long arms.

      * Both players retain their hats, perhaps a nod to Cezanne's father's first business (he owned a hat making company).

## Impressionist paintings are some of the most sought after in the international art market.

#### This page provides information about the most expensive of impressionist works.

Cezanne's The Card Players tops our list, having been sold for $259 million in 2002 (giving it a current price* of $340 million). The average current price of the top 10 works is a whopping \$124 million.

Paul Cezanne has three works in the top five, with works by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Claude Monet and Edouard Manet all making the top ten. And the list of the top 20 dearest impressionist paintings is dominated by Claude Monet, with 12 entries.

The impressionist market show no sign of cooling off: one of [Monet's Haystacks](https://impressionistarts.com/most-expensive-impressionist-paintings.html#6) was sold by Sotheby's New York in May 2019 for \$110.7 million.

Other entries in the list are by lesser known impressionists including Berthe Morisot, Frederic Bazille and Alfred Sisley.

###### \* To ensure a fair comparison between paintings sold at different times in different currencies, we have converted the sale price into dollars using the exchange rate on the date of sale and then updated that figure to reflect inflation until January 2019 (at the rate of 3% per year, compounded annually). All references to \$ are to United States Dollars.

**November 2019 Update:** Sotheby's New York held its latest impressionist evening sale on [12 November 2019](https://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/2019/impressionist-modern-art-evening-n10147.html). Monet's Charing Cross Bridge was the stand-out lot, achieving a price of $27.6 million. Caillebotte's Richard Gallo and His Dog also did well, being sold for $19.68 million.
