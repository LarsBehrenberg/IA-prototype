    topImageTitle: Claude Monet's Impresion Sunrise is the painting that got the
      impressionists their name. But the term 'impressionism' was initially
      deployed by critics as an insult!

## Today, impressionism is the most popular artistic movement.

But when the impressionists were trying to establish themselves in Paris in the 1860s and 1870s, things were very different. On this page, we explain what impressionism is and why it was so controversial, and we introduce the main impressionist painters.

#### What is impressionism?

Though defining impressionism is difficult, most impressionist works have three distinctive qualities.

* They depict either modern life—whether a Parisian street, bathers on the banks of a river or dancers in an opera house—or landscapes, without trying to convey any moral or religious message.
* They use bright colours (many of which had only recently become available) and not the earthy tones that the traditional art establishment, critics and the public expected.
* They use unblended and visible brush strokes.

In addition, most impressionist works were painted fairly quickly (whereas the painters favoured by the establishment would often take years perfecting their works) and often out of doors (paint had recently become available in tubes making painting *en plein air* possible).

Here are three examples of impressionist paintings that display these characteristics.
