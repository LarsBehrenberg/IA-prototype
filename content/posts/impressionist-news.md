      ### Covid-19 has dampened demand for impressionist work at auctions and
      delayed a number of exhibitions.  But it is not all bad news, as we
      explain below.


      The Courtauld Institute is hosting a series of virtual mini-art festivals to help you get through lockdown.  [May 2020](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/open-courtauld-hour-art-in-isolation-tickets-103139410754) sees evenings devoted to Women Artists, the Future of Art History and Art and Wellbeing.


      The Shelbourne Museum in Vermont is also putting on daily [art-related activities](https://shelburnemuseum.org/museum-from-home/ten-two-four-break-challenge/).


      There's an online [auction of autographs](https://www.finebooksmagazine.com/news/mao-marx-autographs-and-artifacts-offered-online-auction) and writings (you can bid until 13 May 2020), with lots including an 8-page letter written by Claude Monet to his second wife, Alice, in 1901.  It comments on the arrangements for Queen Victoria's funeral and Monet's meeting with writer Henry James.


      In February 2020, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts marked its 150th anniversary.  It selected 15 key works for the occasion, including one of Monet's Haystacks (or Grainstacks).
