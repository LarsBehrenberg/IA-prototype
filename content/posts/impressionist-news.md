      ### Covid-19 has dampened demand for impressionist work at auctions and
      delayed a number of exhibitions.  But it is not all bad news, as we
      explain below.


      The Courtauld Institute is hosting a series of virtual mini-art festivals to help you get through lockdown.  [May 2020](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/open-courtauld-hour-art-in-isolation-tickets-103139410754) sees evenings devoted to Women Artists, the Future of Art History and Art and Wellbeing.
