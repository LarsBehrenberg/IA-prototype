      ### Covid-19 has dampened demand for impressionist work at auctions and
      delayed a number of exhibitions.  But it is not all bad news, as we
      explain below.


      #### June 2020


      On 1 June 2020 the Boston Museum of Fine Arts is delivering an online course for children in grades 1-5 entitled [Exploring Impressionism: The Art of Claude Monet](https://mfa.org/event/distance-learning/exploring-impressionism-the-art-of-claude-monet?event=62431).


      #### May 2020


      The UK's Guardian has produced this fun online [art quiz](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/15/how-do-we-know-monet-painted-this-outdoors-the-great-british-art-quiz), including a question about Claude Monet.


      The Foundation Monet has launched an [online tour](https://fondation-monet.com/visite-virtuelle/) of Monet's House in Giverny.  Explore Monet's bedroom, his yellow kitchen adorned with Japanese art, and his blue-tiled kitchen.  


      The house is also home to about 40 of Monet's works (including from the Rouen Cathedral, Haystacks, Westminster Bridge, Houses of Parliament and Venice series) as well as works by other artists (Cezanne in particular).  


      Unfortunately, there is no virtual tour of the gardens (though you can check out some videos on The Foundation Monet's [vimeo channel](https://vimeo.com/fondationmonetgiverny)).  


      The Courtauld Institute is hosting a series of virtual mini-art festivals to help you get through lockdown.  [May 2020](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/open-courtauld-hour-art-in-isolation-tickets-103139410754) sees evenings devoted to Women Artists, the Future of Art History and Art and Wellbeing.


      The Shelbourne Museum in Vermont is also putting on daily [art-related activities](https://shelburnemuseum.org/museum-from-home/ten-two-four-break-challenge/).


      There's an online [auction of autographs](https://www.finebooksmagazine.com/news/mao-marx-autographs-and-artifacts-offered-online-auction) and writings (you can bid until 13 May 2020), with lots including an 8-page letter written by Claude Monet to his second wife, Alice, in 1901.  It comments on the arrangements for Queen Victoria's funeral and Monet's meeting with writer Henry James.


      In February 2020, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts marked its 150th anniversary.  It selected 15 key works for the occasion, including one of Monet's Haystacks (or Grainstacks).
