### Edgar Degas was born in Paris in 1834, his father a wealthy banker and his mother an emigre from New Orleans.

Despite his privileged upbringing, Degas was a difficult person. He was opinionated, demanding and (at least in later life) anti-Semitic. As Caillebotte said during preparations for one of the impressionist exhibitions,

> “He is quite intolerable. But we have to concede that he is extremely talented.”



To make matters worse, Degas had an eye condition identified during the Franco-Prussian war of 1870 that made him extremely sensitive to sunlight and resulted in his near-total blindness from 1901.

But Degas was indeed a genius. He focused on classical technique in the [early years](https://impressionistarts.com/edgar-degas-biography.html#1) of his career, though his famous work from this era*Spartan Girls Challenging Boys*has a number of modern touches. Degas also exhibited in seven of the eight [impressionist exhibitions](https://impressionistarts.com/edgar-degas-biography.html#2), more than many of the key impressionists such as Manet, Monet, Cezanne and Renoir.

Today he is best known for his works of [ballerinas and jockeys](https://impressionistarts.com/edgar-degas-biography.html#3). His works of the ballet are particularly striking: they are incredibly beautiful, they are unusual (often painted from unusual angles), and they also depict the reality of the lives lived by working class dancers—rehearsal, exhaustion, exploitation.

Degas is also rightly famous for a number of works of the New Orleans cotton exchange run by his mother’s family, which he visited in the early 1870s.
